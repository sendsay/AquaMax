 *  OpenAquarium sensor platform for Arduino from Cooking-hacks.
 *
 *  Description: Open Aquarium platform for Arduino control several
 *  parameters in order to make a standalone aquarium. Sensors gather     
 *  information and correct possible errors with different actuators.  
 *
 *  This code synchronizes the date and time of RTC with the computer.
